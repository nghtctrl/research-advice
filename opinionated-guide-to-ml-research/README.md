# Takeaways from An Opinionated Guide to ML Research

Goal-Driven Research vs. Idea-Driven Research

- Goal-driven research begins with a desired outcome or target capability (e.g., make X work for the first time). This helps the researcher to identify problems and ask questions that might help them get closer to the goal. The process involves experimenting with a variety of existing methods from the literature; when these prove insufficient to achieve the goal, the researcher develops new methods that improve upon them.
- Idea-driven research begins when reading an existing method (e.g., a paper on how to do X) inspires an idea for how to do X even better. The researcher then embarks on a project to test this new idea.
- The biggest difference is where your perspective comes from. With goal-driven research, you develop a unique perspective from the start, while idea-driven research tends to keep your perspective similar to that of the literature (and the community).
